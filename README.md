# My Profile #
- Created this README on 10th June 2025 (Tuesday) while learning **Introduction to GitHub** through GitHub Skills, during my semester break after Year 1 Semester 3.

- I have actually worked on some programming assignments before using **C++**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Java** (as of 10/6/2025).

- Me and my teammates only started to use GitHub to compare our codes on Year 1 Semester 3, when we were working on our **Object-Oriented Programming** assignment using **Java**. [Here is the link to the repo (not mine)](https://github.com/tzh652/VehicleRentalSystem/)
  It's a _Vehicle Rental System_, where customers can rent cars or motorcycles there, and staffs can manage the rentals reserved by the customers.
  To be honest as it was our first time, there may be a lot of bugs or mistakes in our code ðŸ™‡, and it certainly doesn't have as many features as any other vehical rental websites have.
